## Support page
Please leave comments/issues here in comments of an extension, in my blog page [Opera Gcal SD extension][http://www.sukys.net/opera-gcal-sd/] or in [GitHub][https://github.com/lrns/opera-gcal-sd/issues]

## Acknowledgements
User authentication and preferences page is based on the code of [Google Reader Notifier][https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/google-reader-notifier/] extension.

## TODO
* Currently, a user has to login in Preferences. Ideally, the browser's session would be shared. That might be possible to do as sharing of cookies with extensions was recently introduced in Opera 11.50 builds.
