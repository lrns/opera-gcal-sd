# Opera Speed Dial Google Calendar extension

This extension displays Google Calendar entries in a Speed Dial tile.

## How to use it:

1. Install extension
2. Log in using your Google account in Preferences
3. (Optional) Select calendars you want to get entries from:
    * Default - only entries from the default calendar displayed
	* Own calendars - entries from all user's calendars are displayed
	* All calendars - all user's calendars as well as subscribed calendars, e.g. Holidays


## Support page
Please leave comments/issues here in comments of an extension or in [GitHub][https://github.com/lrns/opera-gcal-sd/issues]

## Acknowledgements
User authentication and preferences page is based on the code of [Google Reader Notifier][https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/google-reader-notifier/] extension.

## Notes
Sometimes entries get doubled when changing preferences. You can wait until calendar is refreshed or force a manual refresh in Preferences page.

## TODO
* Currently, a user has to login in Preferences. Ideally, the browser's session would be shared. That might be possible to do as sharing of cookies with extensions was recently introduced in Opera 11.50 builds.
